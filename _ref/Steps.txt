Make a cycle
Check for interior edges
If so, split
if not / once done
set all vertices in each polygon as visited
set each used edge. if used twice, remove from usable edges
find an untouched vertex and repeat



====OLD====
pick the vertex with the most connections
find all neighbors
check for edges in list of neighbors
if found, add that edge and return to start
if not, check unvisited nodes for next
after this is done, check last unvisited nodes


// Get a node with only 2 edges [1]
// Extend both sides to only option [0, 1, 2]
// Extend to nodes not in traversal path && different between 2 ends (unless all vertices visted)
// Repeat
